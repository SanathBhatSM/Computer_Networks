# Computer_Networks
This repository contains the implementation of Networking and Communication Protocols using C programming. These programs are part of the Computer Networks Laboratory course of the VTU Curriculum with subject code 18ECL76. 

##Contents


### 1. HLDC Frame Operations
- i) Bit Stuffing
- ii) Character Stuffing

### 2. Distance Vector Algorithm
Write a program for the Distance Vector Algorithm to find a suitable path for transmission.

### 3. Dijkstra's Algorithm
Implement Dijkstra's Algorithm to compute the shortest routing path.

### 4. CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)
For the given data, use the CRC-CCITT polynomial to obtain a CRC code. Verify the program for the cases:
- a. Without Error
- b. With Error

### 5. Stop and Wait Protocol
Implementation of the Stop and Wait Protocol for reliable data transmission.

### 6. Sliding Window Protocol
Implementation of the Sliding Window Protocol for efficient data transmission.

### 7. Congestion Control
Write a program for congestion control using the Leaky Bucket Algorithm.
